**Project**: [Digital Book Report: Hope in the Dark](http://abigailyoung.com/day-3-hope-in-the-dark)  
**Tech**: p5.js, GitHub Pages    
**Code**: [github](http://github.com/abbyoung/day-3-hope-in-the-dark)  

I finished Rebecca Solnit's [Hope in the Dark (Haymarket Press, $5.99)](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/791-hope-in-the-dark) this weekend, and I can't quit thinking about it. Today's exercise is a sort of digital book report, where I'm experimenting more with [p5.js](http://p5js.org): full-screen resizable backgrounds, text, multiple screens, and animated backgrounds.  

While it's not intuitive in my design, a mouse click will scroll through the different screens. [Check it out](http://abigailyoung.com/day-3-hope-in-the-dark), and if you're feeling low lately, [buy the book](https://www.haymarketbooks.org/books/791-hope-in-the-dark).

To share a few more of my favorite quotes&mdash;

> To be antidoctrinal is to open yourself up to new and unexpected alliances, to new networks of power. It's to reject the static utopia in favor of the improvisational journey.

> Activism is not a journey to the corner store, it is a plunge into the unknown. The future is always dark.

> The old certainties are crumbling fast, but danger and possibility are sisters.

> The government and the media routinely discount the effect of activists, but there's no reason we should believe them or let them tally our victories for us.
