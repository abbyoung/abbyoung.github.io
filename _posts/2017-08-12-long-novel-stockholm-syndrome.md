I finished Roberto Bolano's _2666_ last week, and after 893 pages I wanted more.

Around the same time, an old article resurfaced about [Long Novel Stockholm Syndrome](http://www.themillions.com/2011/05/the-stockholm-syndrome-theory-of-long-novels.html). How can I be sure a long novel is truly fantastic, or if it’s holding me hostage, rewarding me with occasional gems to keep me turning pages? Do I just love the accomplishment of finishing a long read?

>If you’re the kind of reader who doesn’t intend to give up on a Great Big Important Novel no matter how inhumanely it treats you, then there’s a sense in which Joyce or Pynchon or Gaddis (or whoever your captor happens to be) owns you for the duration of that captivity. In order to maintain your sanity, you may end up being disproportionately grateful for the parts where they _don’t_ threaten to bore you to death, where there seems to be some genuine empathic connection between reader and writer.

> —Mark O'Connell, "The Stockholm Syndrome Theory of Long Novels"

I admit I have a high tolerance for the slow periods and tangents in long novels. If I’m bored as hell by page 50 in a 350-page book, I’m likely to abandon it. But I hold out when reading an epic, waiting for my reward. I know it’s coming, _it has to be_. And if the book is truly good, I get my reward and it’s worth the effort. It's like bingeing a Netflix series, but in book-form!

Sure, I feel a bit manipulated and trapped once I’m halfway through a 1000-page book. I'm not about to quit halfway when I've already invested hours into those 500 pages. I’ve spent so much time in this world that I need to see the conflicts resolved. 

But at some point, at least in a good book, the reader gets such a strong sense of the world and its outcomes and perils and triumphs and small joys and bigger despairs, that they can almost predict the outcome.

This is how I felt reading Bolano, as he tends to leave the storylines of _2666_ hanging in midair, just enough satisfaction to make you not throw the book against the wall, but still room for speculation and wishing there were more pages. 

I also enjoy the seemingly mundane in long novels, at least the well-written ones. I once read Tolstoy's writing described as, “watching life happen” (can't for the life of me find the source). Endless paragraphs of _watching life happen_ give me the space to reflect, see my own life looking back at me, or squinting hard at the text as if I expect a secret truth of life to jump out at me. Sometimes one does. It’s a meditation for me. I bond with my long reads. Maybe there's some Stockholm Syndrome in there, but in this case, I'm okay with that.

**Some recommendations if you want to give long novels a chance:** Tolstoy’s _War and Peace_ (1392 p.) and _Anna Karenina_ (964 p.) are classics for a reason, Dostoyevsky’s _Crime and Punishment_ (671 p.) is worth it for the murder scene alone, and _2666_ (913 p.) was so good in every way.
