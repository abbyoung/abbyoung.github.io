<h2>Work</h2>
I'm a creative technologist with a background in communications, a fondness for analog tech, and a debilitating sense of user empathy. I like brainstorming big ideas, organizing the shit outta things, and executing + iterating until I die.

🔎 <strong>Currently Exploring</strong>: creative code, ux design, NLP
