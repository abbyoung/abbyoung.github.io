## Work
I'm a creative technologist with a background in communications, a fondness for analog tech, and a debilitating sense of user empathy. I like brainstorming big ideas, organizing the shit outta things, and executing + iterating until I die.

Need help with code, content strategy, user feedback, or something else vaguely related? Hire me for freelance projects through [Good Dog](http://wearegooddog.co).

🔎 **Currently Exploring**: creative code, ux design, NLP
